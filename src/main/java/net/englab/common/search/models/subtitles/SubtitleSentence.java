/**
 * Represents a subtitle sentence that holds the text of the sentence
 * and a range map that associates character indices with subtitle entries.
 *
 * @param text      the text content of the subtitle sentence
 * @param position  the position where the sentence starts in the original subtitle entry
 * @param rangeMap  a range map associating character indices within the sentence to corresponding
 *                  subtitle entry indices. This facilitates identifying which part of the sentence
 *                  aligns with specific subtitle entries. For instance, if we have a sentence that
 *                  starts in the first subtitle entry and ends in the second one, the map might look
 *                  like this: [[0..58]=0, [59..130]=1]
